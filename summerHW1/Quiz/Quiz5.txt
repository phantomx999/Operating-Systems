Assume the following code has been executed by an application which was started in the root directory.
You may assume that all system calls succeed EXCEPT where an error is explicitly checked for.
When will this program terminate?

int count = 0;

DIR* dir = opendir(".");

struct dirent* entry;

while (1) {

     do {

          entry = readdir(dir);

     } while (entry != NULL && entry->d_type != DT_DIR);

  

     if (entry == NULL) {

          char name[PATH_MAX];

          getcwd(name, PATH_MAX);

          printf("The depth of directory %s is %d.\n", name, count);

          exit(0);

     }

 

     // Ignore . and .. as these are not member files or sub-directories.

     if (!strcmp(entry->d_name, ".") || !strcmp(entry->d_name, "..")) continue;

 

     pid_t pid = fork();

     if (pid == 0) {

          chdir(entry->d_name);

          dir = opendir(".");

          ++count;

     }

}

Answer: When the depths of all the directories have been printed.
