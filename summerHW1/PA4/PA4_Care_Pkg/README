This server and client are under development. 
They are a good guide on getting started, but may have lingering errors, which are being fixed over the next week.
If you find an error, please email reproduction to <fulto081 AT umn.edu>

There are two versions of the client and server. The ones with -debug appended to the name. 
server-debug prints out the current tree after each command on the server size. 
client-debug has a wait of two seconds after each response from the server, to make testing for mutlithreading easier.

For each test case, the dag file is entitled "voting_regions.dag"
For each test case, the requests/command file is entitled "input.req"
For each test case, all votes files have the .votes extension. 

YOU CANNOT DEPEND ON ANY OF THESE FILENAMES. Simply accept command line input 
for the dag and requests file, and trust what is in the requests file for votes files.

The correct way of running these would be:

./server TestCases/TestCase01/voting_regions.dag 4061
./client TestCases/TestCase01/input.req 127.0.0.1 4061

Obviously, you can replace the port number and/or IP address for the correct one.


Again, there may be an error in these executeables, if you find one please let me know.
